<h1>Attributions</h1> 

<p>While the project was planned and conducted independently by the team, it is important that we attribute all the wonderful people who have supported and inspired us. We could not have realised our project without them. 
</p>

<h3>Principal Investigator</h3>  

 
<p>Verena Seiwers  
(Research Professor) 
</p>
Verena started up the team and have remained PI... 

Verena have provided training and guidance to the team through an introductory synthetic biology course and provided feedback throughout the project. 

Her support have been invaluable for avoiding pitfalls and realizing the project... 

<h3>Supervisors</h3> 

<p>
Andrea Clausen Lind  
(PhD student)</p> 

 
<p>
Angelo Limeta 
(PhD student) 
</p>
 
As supervisors of the team, Andrea and Angelo have guided us through the brainstorming process and acted as capable mentors in every aspect of the project. They have especially supported us in the design and planning of experiments, as well as a source of laboratory know-how. As previous iGEM members themselves they have inspired us and centered our focus on what would be important for completing the project. 

 We were also provided a lab bench and most laboratory consumables through Sotiriosâ€™ group as well as training and guidance. 

 

<h3> Help and support</h3>
