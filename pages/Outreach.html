    <h1>Outreach</h1> 

On outreach from the iGEM webpage: Community outreach programs to help advertise the project. A community outreach can be going to organizations in your community and talking about the project. Teams can develop an open house and invite community leaders to explore synthetic biology and present their project. These activities are wonderful tools to solicit donations for the teams to buy supplies and travel to the Jamboree.
