       Establishing long term connections and collaborations are important everywhere; both at personal level and at industry level. Even in iGEM this can prove to be useful and help teams progressing in their projects, pushing each other along the way. Those long term collaborations - which iGEM usually refer to as partnerships - can come in many forms; from helping comming up with ideas, to do labwork and help with each others projects, to developing softwares in joint aim. <br><br>

       Continuing on the partnership with Team:UNILausanne (Switzerland) which started with our respective previous teams 2020, we and UNILausanne have worked together to make science in all its nature more easier accessible and understandable for the general public, as independently of where one lives as possible. While this is no easy task and can be done in several ways the aim of this partnership is reach people through their own languages by recognising the many different languages our teams knows and thus translation capabilities. <br><br> 

On this page a description of our partnership with Lausanne and what we done can be found.

              In 2020 both Lausannes and our predecessors started a partnership with the aim to make science more accessible for the general public. How they started the partnership and what they accomplished their year can be read about <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:UNILausanne/Education">here</a> and <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg/Education">here</a>. Making science understandable and accessible for the general public is hard and there already exist several blogs and attempts to accomplish this. Though, most lack one thing; diversity in language. This on the other hand is why our partnership with Lausanne can contribute. Being a Swedish and Swizz team, both with international students, we cover several different languages. Thus, by writing in English both teams can translate the content to respectively known language in the teams and thus reach more people; people who else may have trouble understanding English.    
<br><br>
To continue on our predecessors partnership we and this years Lausannes iGEM team established early contact discussing how we should progress with the blog. Just like the previous year Lasuanne and us have several languages at our disposal, and also a big interest in spreading science, making it more accessible by creating easy-to-read content of complex subjects for the general public in several languages.

           Scientific reports are usually written in English, using complex vocabularies only understandable for those in or closely related to the the reports scientific field. Thus, most people that actually can read an article needs to have an basic understanding or background in the articles main subject before reading it. Of course if you would have an academic background you are probably used to reading articles and can probably get through it, hopefully understanding bits and pieces.  
       </div> 
   </div>
   <div class="row">
     <div class="col-lg-12">
      But it would take more of an effort to read it and probably more resources and articles that can help you decipher the meanings of each sentences. Worse though would be if you had no academic background and possibly no affiliation except interest. Then the actual content would be somewhat gibberish.
<br><br>

The transcriptome is a blog which is hosted by team:UNILausanne and team:Chalmers-Gothenburg in a joint partnership which aims to write blog posts about scientific subjects; posts which are easy to understand for anyone with enough interest to read it. 
To actually accomplish this, it is important to realise some key issues with how science is mostly displayed qurrently:

<ul style="width:70%; margin-left:10%;">
    <li> Scientific articles are difficult to read and understand, mostly due to concepts and vocabularies not being properly explained in the articles. </li>
    <li> Scientific articles are mainly written in English, leaving most people unable to read it properly.</li>
    <li> While papers such as news papers sometimes report on scientific findings in more casual text, they are usually written by someone probably not affiliated with the field and possibly not portraying it as good as it could be and ... </li>
    <li> such posts are often not free to read.</li>
</ul>
E.g. if you would be a poor high school student in a country where English is not the native tongue and is not part of your daily life, then you would miss out big time. The transcriptome works around all that by being free for all readers, given options on multiple languages for each post and providing easy-to-read and easy-to-understand posts which explains complex concepts and scientific words used in normal articles. This while still keeping the posts enough complex and in-depth of the subject as possible. 
<br><br>
On the transcriptome we post about various scientific topics. While most posts stay true to our teams background, synthetic biology, there have also been topics such as biology, math, diseases and their origin. At the transcriptome we try to keep it simple, yet in-depth and broad, including as many readers as possible wherever they might come from.
